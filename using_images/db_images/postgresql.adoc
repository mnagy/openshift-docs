== Overview
The OpenShift https://github.com/openshift/postgresql[PostgreSQL] database image
repository contains the sources and Dockerfiles for building PostgreSQL database
images. The resulting images can be run by Docker.

== Versions
Currently, OpenShift only supports version
https://github.com/openshift/postgresql/tree/master/9.2[9.2] of PostgreSQL.

== Base Images

The following base images are currently available:

* RHEL 7
* CentOS 7

[NOTE]
====
In order to perform a build action on a RHEL 7 based PostgreSQL image, you must
run the build on a properly subscribed RHEL 7 machine.
====

== Installation
To build a PostgreSQL image, use one of the following procedures, depending on
your base image:

*RHEL 7 Base Image*

To build a RHEL 7 based PostgreSQL image:

. Clone the following repository:
+
****
`$ git clone https://github.com/openshift/postgresql.git`
****
. Navigate into the directory you just created:
+
****
`$ cd postgresql`
****
. Build the image:
+
****
`$ make build TARGET=rhel7 VERSION=9.2`
****

*CentOS 7 Base Image*

To build a CentOS 7 based PostgreSQL image:

This image is available on DockerHub. To download it:

****
`$ docker pull openshift/postgresql-92-centos7`
****

Alternatively, you can build a CentOS 7 based PostgreSQL image:

. Clone the following repository:
+
****
`$ git clone https://github.com/openshift/postgresql.git`
****
. Navigate into the directory you just created:
+
****
`$ cd postgresql`
****
. Build the image:
+
****
`$ make build VERSION=9.2`
****

[NOTE]
====
If you omit the `VERSION` parameter, then the build action is performed on all
the supported versions of PostgreSQL. Currently, only version 9.2 is supported,
so you can omit this parameter.
====

== Usage
To create a container running PostgreSQL, you must run the following commands
depending on your base image.

*RHEL 7 image*

To create a container running PostgreSQL with a RHEL 7 base image:

****
`$ docker run -d --name _<database>_ -e POSTGRESQL_USER=_<user>_ -e POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=_<password>_ -e POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=_<database>_ -p 5432:5432 openshift/postgresql-92-rhel7`
****

This creates a container named with the credentials and database that you
specified.

*CentOS 7 image*

To create a container running PostgreSQL with a RHEL 7 base image:

****
`$ docker run -d --name _<database>_ -e POSTGRESQL_USER=_<user>_ -e POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=_<password>_ -e POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=_<database>_ -p 5432:5432 openshift/postgresql-92-centos7`
****

To access and test if the application is running:

****
`$ psql -c "SELECT 1;" postgresql://_<user>_@127.0.0.1:5432/_<database>_`
****

To properly stop the container:

****
`$ docker stop _<postgresql_container>_`
****

== Testing

This repository also provides a test framework which checks basic functionality
of the PostgreSQL image.

Select whether the PostgreSQL image you are testing is RHEL based or CentOS based.

*RHEL 7 Base Image*

To test a RHEL 7 based PostgreSQL image, run the test on a properly subscribed RHEL
machine.

. Navigate into the *_postgresql_* directory:
+
****
`$ cd postgresql`
****
. Test the image:
+
****
`$ make test TARGET=rhel7 VERSION=9.2`
****

*CentOS 7 Base Image*

To test a CentOS 7 based PostgreSQL image:

. Navigate into the *_postgresql_* directory:
+
****
`$ cd postgresql`
****
. Test the image:
****
`$ make test VERSION=9.2`
****

[NOTE]
====
If you omit the `VERSION` parameter, then the build action is performed on all
the supported versions of PostgreSQL. Currently, only version 9.2 is supported,
so you can omit this parameter.
====

== Environment variables

The image recognizes the following environment variables that you can set
during initialization with this command:

****
`$ docker run -e VAR=_<variable>_`
****

.Repository Organization
[cols="4a,6a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable name |Description

|`*POSTGRESQL_USER*`
|Username for the PostgreSQL account to be created. This user has full rights to
the database.

|`*POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD*`
|Password for the user account.

|`*POSTGRESQL_DATABASE*`
|Database name.

|`*POSTGRESQL_ADMIN_PASSWORD*`
|Optional password for the `postgres` admin user. If this is not set, then
remote login to the `postgres` account is not possible. Local connections from
within the container are always permitted without a password.
|===

=== Settings

PostgreSQL settings can be configured with the following environment variables.

.Additional PostgreSQL settings
[cols="3a,6a,1a",options="header"]

|Variable name |Description |Default

|`*POSTGRESQL_MAX_CONNECTIONS*`
|The maximum number of client connections allowed. This also sets the maximum
number of prepared transactions.
|100

|`*POSTGRESQL_SHARED_BUFFERS*`
|Configures how much memory is dedicated to PostgreSQL for caching data.
|32M

== Volumes

* *_/var/lib/pgsql/data_* - This is the database cluster directory where
PostgreSQL stores database files.

== Image Name Structure

Use the following image name structure:

****
`openshift/[replaceable]#<platform_name>#-[replaceable]#<platform_version>#-[replaceable]#<base_builder_image>#`
****

Where:

. [replaceable]#<platform_name># - Refers to the provided service; for example, `postgresql`
. [replaceable]#<platform_version># - The version of the referenced service, without dots; for example, `92` for PostgreSQL 9.2
. [replaceable]#<Base_builder_image># - The base OS, such as `rhel7` or `centos7`

.Example image names:
====

----
openshift/postgresql-92-centos7
openshift/postgresql-92-rhel7
